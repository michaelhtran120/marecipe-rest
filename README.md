# MaRecipe Rest API
This is my first go at building a Restful API using Express and MongoDb.

This is for my macro recipe tracking application.

### 2/17/22

This is a fully functional REST API for MaRecipe. Currently in the process of building out the front-end / client side, but this can be tested using Postman.

Further details to be added soon.
