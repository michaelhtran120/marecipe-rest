# MaRecipe Rest API
This is my first go at building a Restful API using Express and MongoDb.

This is for my macro recipe tracking application.

### 2/17/22

This is a functional REST API for MaRecipe. Currently in the process of building out the front-end / client side. This is using MongoDB locally with a data folder outside of this repo.
This was built for the purpose of practice and implementation for a future RESTful API for my recipe application.

If you would like a walk through of this project or showcase using Postman (or my front-end application once completed) please reach out to me on LinkedIn or via my website.
